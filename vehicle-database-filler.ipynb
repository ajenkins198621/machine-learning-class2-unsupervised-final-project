    "I have a small company that I run as a project that gathers information about GM vehicles.  Within this company, we parse PDF invoices and extract important information from them.  Since this data comes across as a list of strings, we need to convert this data into a structured format.  I've been doing this in PHP and extracting the data based on the position of the data in the string.  This can sometimes lead to incorrect results.  So, I want to try to use machine learning to extract the data from the strings and fill in any missing parts."

    "I currently have a MySQL database that contains many tables, but the one we're most interested in is the `vehicles` table.  This table contains the following columns:\n",
    "- vin - A 17 digit string that is unique to each vehicle\n",
    "- year - The year the vehicle was made\n",
    "- make - The make of the vehicle (ex: Chevrolet, GMC, etc.)\n",
    "- peg_rpo_code - A 3 digit string code that represents the vehicle's trim level\n",
    "- peg_description - A description of the vehicle's trim level\n",
    "- exterior_color_rpo_code - A 3 digit string code that represents the vehicle's exterior color\n",
    "- exterior_color_description - A description of the vehicle's exterior color\n",
    "- interior_color_rpo_code - A 3 digit string code that represents the vehicle's interior color\n",
    "- interior_color_description - A description of the vehicle's interior color\n",
    "- engine_rpo_code - A 3 digit string code that represents the vehicle's engine\n",
    "- engine_description - A description of the vehicle's engine\n",

    "This data does not include the long string from the PDF of the vehicle.  To add this in, I had to write a script within the app which was written in PHP to convert the PDF to a string and append it to each.  This process took quite a while to run.  Within this script I had it output to a csv so that we can use it for our modeling.  This csv is located within the /data/train.csv folder of this repository.\n",
